# Pre-Class Practice Notes

I missed last week's class as I was ill. However, I made some improvements on my rig from the previous week, and observations from the class before. 

I've been working on experiments to pull inputs from a local network. From previous discussion with the professor, this is one possible solution that I could use as an input for the AOP. 

Other things to look into based on the in class exercise: polyrhythms and varying the beat duration of the instrument involved in the sound produced to create for interesting overlays in sound. For now these are mere sketches, scribbles and ideas as I was not able to perform the preliminary tests to determine the appropriate direction.

I also updated the documented of this project. (See Below)

In my TECH research: I looked into some of the new functionalities that NEXUS had to see what I could utilise for my implementation, and https://www.collab-hub.io/ which was suggested by Prof Doug.

In HARDWARE research: I purchased both a 3.5mm to Dual 1/4 Inch Cable 1/8" TRS to 2 6.35mm TS Mono Y Splitter Male to Male , and a single of the same type. I also researched macropads and way to build my own macropad by repurposing a USB numpad and using Karabiner on Mac. 

IN LITERATURE research: I started reading  "Listening to noise and silence: Towards a philosophy of sound art" by Salome Voegelin (2010). Bloomsbury Publishing USA. Its chapters titled: “Listening”, “Noise”, “Silence”, “Time and Space”, and “Now”, correlate beautifully with what I am trying to do with this AOP.
